Observations:

1) It is clear that in schools no larger than 2000 students, average test scores and the passing rates of test scores are much higher than those exceeding student populations of 2000.
2) Charter Schools seem to have higher average test scores and higher passing rates than district schools. The widest margin between the two types of schools being with math scores.
3) Strangely, the lower the spending per student rates are, the higher the average test scores and % passing rates among schools.
